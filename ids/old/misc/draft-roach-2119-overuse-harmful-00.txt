1.  Introduction

   Introduction

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The English words "must", "required", "shall", "should",
   "recommended", "may", "optional", and "not" in this document are to
   be interpreted as conveying their ordinary, well-understood meanings.

   Barry Leiba: "These words may also appear in this document in lower
   case as plain English words, absent their normative meanings."

3.  Clarification

   [RFC2119] itself cautions that "Imperatives of the type defined in
   this memo must be used with care and sparingly."

   Barry Leiba: "The trouble with the "non-normative synonyms" is that
   it makes document text awkward, by requiring us to artificially
   substitute less apt words, when "may" and "should", as English words,
   are exactly what we mean."

   Randy Bush: "[D]o we not already have enough problems being clear and
   concise without removing common words from our language?"

4.  Security Considerations

   The overuse of [RFC2119] normative terms can lead to reader fatigue,
   which can cause implementors to overlook actually important
   implementation requirements.  Some of these requirements may be
   security related.
