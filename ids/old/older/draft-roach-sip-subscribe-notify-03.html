<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029452"></A>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide a generic and extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain events have occurred.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030060"></A>Concrete uses of the mechanism described in this document may be standardized in the future.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1031355"></A>2.	Introduction</H1>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030063"></A>The ability to request asynchronous notification of events proves useful in many types of services for which cooperation between end-nodes is required. Examples of such services include automatic callback services (based on terminal state events), buddy lists (based on user presence events), message waiting indications (based on mailbox state change events), and PINT status (based on call state events).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029545"></A>The methods described in this document allow a framework by which notification of these events can be ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030126"></A>Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event subscription and notification. Meeting requirements for the general problem set of subscription and notification is far too complex for a single protocol. Our goal is to provide a general framework for event notification which is not so complex as to be unusable for simple features, but which is still flexible enough to provide powerful services. However, extensions based on this framework may define arbitrarily complex rules which govern the subscription and notification for the events or classes of events they describe.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031210"></A>Note that this draft does not describe an extension which may be used directly; it must be extended by other drafts (herein referred to as &quot;extension drafts&quot; and &quot;event packages.&quot;) In object-oriented design terminology, it may be thought of as an abstract base class which must be derived into an instantiatable class by further extensions. Guidelines for creating these extensions are described in section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.html#68360" CLASS="XRef">3.</A></P>

<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030419"></A>2.1.	Overview of Operation</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030590"></A>The general concept is that entities in the network can subscribe to resource or call state for various resources or calls in the network, and those entities (or entities acting on their behalf) can send notifications when those states change.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030625"></A>A typical flow of messages would be:</P>
<P><PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1030591"></A>Subscriber          Notifier
    |-----SUBSCRIBE----&gt;|     Request state subscription
    |&lt;-------200--------|     Acknowledge subscription
    |&lt;------NOTIFY----- |     Return current state information
    |--------200-------&gt;|
    |&lt;------NOTIFY----- |     Return current state information
    |--------200-------&gt;|</PRE>
</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030615"></A>The subscriber and notifier entities need not necessarily be UAs, but often will be.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030626"></A>Subscriptions are expired and must be refreshed in exactly the same manner as registrations (see RFC 2543 <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.html#53863" CLASS="XRef">[1]</A>).</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1030421"></A>3.	<A NAME="68360"></A>Extension Considerations</H1>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030394"></A>This section covers several issues which should be taken into consideration when SIP extensions based on SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY are proposed.</P>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030382"></A>3.1.	Appropriateness of Usage</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030383"></A>When using the methods described in this draft for event notification, it is important to consider: is SIP an appropriate mechanism for the problem set? Is SIP being selected because of some unique feature provided by the protocol (e.g. user mobility), or merely because &quot;it can be done?&quot; If you find yourself defining SIP extensions for notifications related to, for example, network management or the temperature inside your car's engine, you may want to reconsider your selection of protocols.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030384"></A>Those interested in extending the mechanism defined in this document are urged to read &quot;Guidelines for Authors of SIP Extensions&quot;<A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.html#42297" CLASS="XRef">[3]</A> for further guidance regarding appropriate uses of SIP.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030388"></A>Further, it is expected that this mechanism is not to be used in applications where the frequency of reportable events is excessively rapid (e.g. more than about once per second). A SIP network is generally going to be provisioned for a reasonable signalling volume; sending a notification every time a user's GPS position changes by one hundreth of a second could easily overload such a network.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030380"></A>3.2.	Additional Guidelines</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030393"></A>When writing extensions based on SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, it is important to consider the type of information which will be conveyed during a notification.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030401"></A>A natural temptation is to convey merely the event (e.g. &quot;a new voice message just arrived&quot;) without accompanying state (e.g. &quot;7 total voice messages&quot;). This complicates implementation of subscribing entities (since they have to maintain complete state for the entity to which they have subscribed), and also is particularly susceptible to synchronization problems.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030941"></A>It is therefore suggested that extensions are designed so as to notify of new state when an event occurs. In the circumstances that state may not be sufficient for a particular class of events, the extensions should include complete state information along with the event that occurred. (For example, &quot;no customer service representatives available&quot; may not be as useful &quot;no customer service representatives available; representative sip:46@cs.xyz.int just logged off&quot;.)</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030954"></A>Note that neither SUBSCRIBE nor NOTIFY necessitate the use of &quot;Require&quot; or &quot;Proxy-Require&quot; headers; similarly, there is no token defined for &quot;Supported&quot; headers.

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031420"></A>For the purposes of generality, both SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY MAY be canceled; however, doing so is not recommended. Successfully cancelled SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests MUST be completed with a &quot;487 Request Cancelled&quot; response; the server acts as if the request were never received.

<A NAME="pgfId-1030030"></A>A subscription is uniquely identified by the combination of the To, From, and Call-ID fields in the SUBSCRIBE request. Refreshes of subscriptions SHOULD reuse the same Call-ID if possible, since subscriptions are uniquely identified at presence servers using the Call-ID.

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032001"></A>SUBSCRIBE requests MUST contain an &quot;Expires&quot; header. This expires value indicates the duration of the subscription. The formatting of these is described in RFC 2543. In order to keep subscriptions effective beyond the duration communicated in the &quot;Expires&quot; header, subscribers need to refresh subscriptions on a periodic basis. This refreshing is performed in the same way as REGISTER refreshes: the To, From, and Call-ID match those in the SUBSCRIBE being refreshed, while the CSeq number is incremented.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032011"></A>200-class responses to SUBSCRIBE requests also MUST contain an &quot;Expires&quot; header. The period of time in the response MAY be shorter than specified in the request, but MUST NOT be longer. The period of time in the response is the one which defines the duration of the subscription.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032030"></A>Similar to REGISTER requests, SUBSCRIBE requests may be renewed at any time to prevent them from expiring at the end of the &quot;Expires&quot; period. These renewals will contain a the same &quot;To,&quot; &quot;From,&quot; and &quot;Call-ID&quot; as the original request, and an incremented &quot;CSeq&quot; number.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032032"></A>Also similar to REGISTER requests, a natural consequence of this scheme is that a SUBSCRIBE with an &quot;Expires&quot; of 0 constitutes a request to unsubscribe from an event.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031441"></A>Notifiers may also wish to cancel subscriptions to events; this is useful, for example, when the resource to which a subscription refers is no longer available.

<A NAME="pgfId-1030278"></A>The Request URI of a SUBSCRIBE request, most importantly, contains enough information to route the request to the appropriate entity. It also contains enough information to identify the resource for which event notification is desired, but not necessarily enough information to uniquely identify the nature of the event (e.g. &quot;sip:adam.roach@ericsson.com&quot; would be an appropriate URI to subscribe to for my presence state; it would also be an appropriate URI to subscribe to the state of my voice mailbox).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032146"></A>Subscribers MUST include exactly one &quot;Event&quot; header in SUBSCRIBE requests, indicating to which event or class of events they are subscribing. The &quot;Event&quot; header will contain a single opaque token which identifies the event or class of events for which a subscription is being requested. This token will be registered with the IANA and will correspond to an extension draft which further describes the semantics of the event or event class.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030447"></A>The &quot;Event&quot; header is considered mandatory for the purposes of this document. However, to maintain compatibility with PINT (see <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.html#33731" CLASS="XRef">[4]</A>), servers MAY interpret a SUBSCRIBE request with no &quot;Event&quot; header as requesting a subscription to PINT events. If the servers do not support PINT, they SHOULD instead return &quot;400 Bad Request.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030286"></A>If the extension draft to which the event token corresponds defines behavior associated with the body of its SUBSCRIBE requests, those semantics apply. It is expected that most, but not all, extension drafts will define syntax and semantics for SUBSCRIBE method bodies; these bodies will typically modify, expand, filter, throttle, and/or set thresholds for the class of events being requested. Designers of extensions are strongly encouraged to re-use existing MIME types for message bodies where practical.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032310"></A>The only comments I've received on this issue so far favor deciding that this premise is not generally applicable, removing it as an open issue.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1031614"></A>7.2.	Event Throttling</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031615"></A>Is the concept of throttling events (e.g. &quot;never inform me of events more frequently than once every n seconds, no matter what&quot;) useful enough across all event types that we should define a top-level mechanism for this, or do we let extension drafts that might benefit from this sort of scheme define their own throttles?</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032311"></A>The comments I've received on this topic are split between suggesting that event packages should define their own throttles, if appropriate, and suggesting that a general-purpose throttle mechanism would save event-package creators unnecessary re-invention of the same concepts. Supporting arguments for both viewpoints should be taken to the sip-events mailing list, please (see section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.html#38853" CLASS="XRef">11.</A>)</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1031767"></A>7.3.	Resource identification for out-of-band subscriptions</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031770"></A>In this draft, we explicitly allow subscriptions to be put into place via a mechanism other than a SUBSCRIBE request. Many people believe that sanctioning of such behavior in the base draft is important. It raises an interesting issue, however, that is probably not completely appropriate for this draft to solve. For documentation purposes, the problem is this: In a SUBSCRIBE request, the request URI is used to identify the resource (although not the event) to which a subscription is requested; If there is no explicit SUBSCRIBE, this information doesn't really exist anywhere.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1032316"></A>I get the general feeling that this problem isn't well understood by the community, and that it deserves a great deal more thought than it's receiving.</P>

<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031681"></A>8.1.	Changes from -02</H2>
<P><PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031705"></A>- Clarification under &quot;Notifier SUBSCRIBE behavior&quot; which
  indicates that the first NOTIFY message (sent immediately
  in response to a SUBSCRIBE) may contain an empty body, if
  resource state doesn't make sense at that point in time.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031714"></A>- Text on message flow in overview section corrected</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031718"></A>- Removed suggestion that clients attempt to unsubscribe
  whenever they receive a NOTIFY for an unknown event.
  Such behavior opens up DOS attacks, and will lead to
  message loops unless additional precautions are taken.
  The 481 response to the NOTIFY should serve the same
  purpose.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031972"></A>- Changed processing of non-200 responses to NOTIFY from
  &quot;SHOULD remove contact&quot; to &quot;MUST remove contact&quot; to support
  the above change.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031782"></A>- Re-added discussion of out-of-band subscription mechanisms
  (including open issue of resource identification).</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031837"></A>- Added text specifying that SUBSCRIBE transactions are not
  to be prolonged. This is based on the consensus that non-INVITE
  transactions should never be prolonged; such consensus within
  the SIP working group was reached at the 49th IETF.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031838"></A>- Added &quot;202 Accepted&quot; response code to support the above
  change. The behavior of this 202 response code is a
  generalization of that described in the presence draft <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-03.html#78899" CLASS="XRef">[5]</A>.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031854"></A>- Updated to specify that the response to an unauthorized
  SUBSCRIBE request is 603 or 403.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031885"></A>- Level-4 subheadings added to particularly long sections to
  break them up into logical units. This helps make the
  behavior description seem somewhat less rambling. This also
  caused some re-ordering of these paragraphs (hopefully in a
  way that makes them more readable).</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031913"></A>- Some final mopping up of old text describing &quot;call related&quot;
  and &quot;third party&quot; subscriptions (deprecated concepts).</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032051"></A>- Duplicate explanation of subscription duration removed from
  subscriber SUBSCRIBE behavior section.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032160"></A>- Other text generally applicable to SUBSCRIBE (instead of just
  subscriber handling of SUBSCRIBE) moved to parent section.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032057"></A>- Updated header table to reflect mandatory usage of &quot;Expires&quot;
  header in SUBSCRIBE requests and responses</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032159"></A>- Removed &quot;Event&quot; header usage in responses</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032249"></A>- Added sentence suggesting that notifiers may notify
  subscribers when a subscription has timed out.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032319"></A>- Clarified that a failed attempt to refresh a subscription
  does not imply that the original subscription has been
  cancelled.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032353"></A>- Clarified that 489 is a valid response to &quot;NOTIFY&quot; requests.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1032358"></A>- Minor editorial changes to clean up awkward and/or unclear
  grammar in several places</PRE>

<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031682"></A>8.2.	Changes from -01</H2>
<P><PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031617"></A>- Multiple contacts per SUBSCRIBE message disallowed.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031618"></A>- Contact header now required in NOTIFY messages.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031619"></A>- Distinction between third party/call member events removed.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031620"></A>- Distinction between call-related/resource-related events removed.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031621"></A>- Clarified that subscribers must expect NOTIFY messages before
  the SUBSCRIBE transaction completes</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031622"></A>- Added immediate NOTIFY message after successful SUBSCRIBE;
  this solves a myriad of issues, most having to do with forking.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031623"></A>- Added discussion of &quot;undefined state&quot; (before a NOTIFY arrives).</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031624"></A>- Added mechanism for notifiers to shorten/cancel outstanding
  subscriptions.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031625"></A>- Removed open issue about appropriateness of new &quot;489&quot; response.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031626"></A>- Removed all discussion of out-of-band subscriptions.</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1031678"></A>- Added brief discussion of event state polling.</PRE>
