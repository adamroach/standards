<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029452"></A>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#53863" CLASS="XRef">[1]</A>. The purpose of this extension is to provide a generic and extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain events have occurred.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030060"></A>Concrete uses of the mechanism described in this document may be standardized in the future.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1031355"></A>2.	Introduction</H1>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030063"></A>The ability to request asynchronous notification of events proves useful in many types of services for which cooperation between end-nodes is required. Examples of such services include automatic callback services (based on terminal state events), buddy lists (based on user presence events), message waiting indications (based on mailbox state change events), and PINT status (based on call state events).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029545"></A>The methods described in this document allow a framework by which notification of these events can be ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030126"></A>Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event subscription and notification. Meeting requirements for the general problem set of subscription and notification is far too complex for a single protocol. Our goal is to provide a general framework for event notification which is not so complex as to be unusable for simple features, but which is still flexible enough to provide powerful services. However, extensions based on this framework may define arbitrarily complex rules which govern the subscription and notification for the events or classes of events they describe.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031210"></A>Note that this draft does not describe an extension which may be used directly; it must be extended by other drafts (herein referred to as &quot;extension drafts&quot; and &quot;event packages.&quot;) In object-oriented design terminology, it may be thought of as an abstract base class which must be derived into an instantiatable class by further extensions. Guidelines for creating these extensions are described in section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#68360" CLASS="XRef">3.</A></P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1030419"></A>2.1.	Overview of Operation</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030590"></A>The general concept is that entities in the network can subscribe to resource or call state for various resources or calls in the network, and those entities (or entities acting on their behalf) can send notifications when those states change.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030625"></A>A typical flow of messages would be:</P>
<P><PRE CLASS="Preformat"><A NAME="pgfId-1030591"></A>Subscriber          Notifier
    |-----SUBSCRIBE----&gt;|     Request state subscription
    |&lt;-------200--------|     Return current state information
    |&lt;------NOTIFY----- |     Return current state information
    |--------200-------&gt;|
    |&lt;------NOTIFY----- |     Return current state information
    |--------200-------&gt;|</PRE>
</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030615"></A>The subscriber and notifier entities need not necessarily be UAs, but often will be.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030626"></A>Subscriptions are expired and must be refreshed in exactly the same manner as registrations (see RFC 2543 <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#53863" CLASS="XRef">[1]</A>).</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1030421"></A>3.	<A NAME="68360"></A>Extension Considerations</H1>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030394"></A>This section covers several issues which should be taken into consideration when SIP extensions based on SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY are proposed.</P>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030382"></A>3.1.	Appropriateness of Usage</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030383"></A>When using the methods described in this draft for event notification, it is important to consider: is SIP an appropriate mechanism for the problem set? Is SIP being selected because of some unique feature provided by the protocol (e.g. user mobility), or merely because &quot;it can be done?&quot; If you find yourself defining SIP extensions for notifications related to, for example, network management or the temperature inside your car's engine, you may want to reconsider your selection of protocols.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030384"></A>Those interested in extending the mechanism defined in this document are urged to read &quot;Guidelines for Authors of SIP Extensions&quot;<A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#42297" CLASS="XRef">[3]</A> for further guidance regarding appropriate uses of SIP.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030388"></A>Further, it is expected that this mechanism is not to be used in applications where the frequency of reportable events is excessively rapid (e.g. more than about once per second). A SIP network is generally going to be provisioned for a reasonable signalling volume; sending a notification every time a user's GPS position changes by one hundreth of a second could easily overload such a network.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="Heading2">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030380"></A>3.2.	Additional Guidelines</H2>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030393"></A>When writing extensions based on SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, it is important to consider the type of information which will be conveyed during a notification.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030401"></A>A natural temptation is to convey merely the event (e.g. &quot;a new voice message just arrived&quot;) without accompanying state (e.g. &quot;7 total voice messages&quot;). This complicates implementation of subscribing entities (since they have to maintain complete state for the entity to which they have subscribed), and also is particularly susceptible to synchronization problems.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030941"></A>It is therefore suggested that extensions are designed so as to notify of new state when an event occurs. In the circumstances that state may not be sufficient for a particular class of events, the extensions should include complete state information along with the event that occurred. (For example, &quot;no customer service representatives available&quot; may not be as useful &quot;no customer service representatives available; representative sip:46@cs.xyz.int just logged off&quot;.)</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029873"></A>Similarly, unless noted otherwise, third-party SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests follow the same protocol rules as those defined in RFC 2543 <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#53863" CLASS="XRef">[1]</A> for OPTIONS.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030954"></A>Note that neither SUBSCRIBE nor NOTIFY necessitate the use of &quot;Require&quot; or &quot;Proxy-Require&quot; headers; similarly, there is no token defined for &quot;Supported&quot; headers. If necessary, clients may probe for the support of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY using the OPTIONS request defined in RFC2543.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031420"></A>For the purposes of generality, both SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY MAY be canceled; however, doing so is not recommended.

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030030"></A>A subscription is uniquely identified by the combination of the To, Call-ID and the From field in the SUBSCRIBE request. Refreshes of subscriptions SHOULD reuse the same Call-ID if possible, since subscriptions are uniquely identified at presence servers using the Call-ID. Two subscriptions from the same user, for the same user, but with different Call-IDs, are considered different subscriptions. Note this is exactly the same as usage of Call-ID in registrations.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">

<H3 CLASS="Heading3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030002"></A>5.1.2.	Subscription duration</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029937"></A>All SUBSCRIBE requests are required to contain an &quot;Expires&quot; header. This value specifies for how long the subscription is to remain in effect. The 200 response to a SUBSCRIBE request also MUST contain an &quot;Expires&quot; header. The period of time in the response MAY be shorter than specified in the request, but MUST NOT be longer. The period of time in the response is the one which defines the duration of the subscription.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1029993"></A>Similar to REGISTER requests, SUBSCRIBE requests may be renewed at any time to prevent them from expiring at the end of the &quot;Expires&quot; period. These renewals will contain a the same &quot;To,&quot; &quot;From,&quot; and &quot;Call-ID&quot; as the original request, and an incremented &quot;CSeq&quot; number. Subscriptions may similarly be cancelled by re-issuing them with an &quot;Expires: 0&quot; header.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031441"></A>Further, notifiers may wish to cancel subscriptions to events; this is useful, for example, when the resource to which a subscription refers is no longer available.

<A NAME="pgfId-1030276"></A>5.1.3.	<A NAME="28631"></A>Identification of Subscribed Events and Event Classes</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030277"></A>Identification of events is provided by three pieces of information: Request URI, Event Type, and (optionally) message body.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030278"></A>The Request URI of a SUBSCRIBE request, most importantly, contains enough information to route the request to the appropriate entity. It also contains enough information to identify the resource for which event notification is desired, but not necessarily enough information to uniquely identify the nature of the event (e.g. &quot;sip:adam.roach@ericsson.com&quot; would be an appropriate URI to subscribe to for my presence state; it would also be an appropriate URI to subscribe to the state of my voice mailbox).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030279"></A>The &quot;Event&quot; header will contain a single opaque token which identifies the event or class of events for which a subscription is being requested. This token will be registered with the IANA and will correspond to an extension draft which further describes the semantics of the event or event class.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030447"></A>The &quot;Event&quot; header is considered mandatory for the purposes of this document. However, to maintain compatibility with PINT (see <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#33731" CLASS="XRef">[4]</A>), servers MAY interpret a SUBSCRIBE request with no &quot;Event&quot; header as requesting a subscription to PINT events. If the servers do not support PINT, they SHOULD instead return &quot;400 Bad Request.&quot;</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1030286"></A>If the extension draft to which the event token corresponds defines behavior associated with the body of its SUBSCRIBE requests, those semantics apply. It is expected that most, but not all, extension drafts will define syntax and semantics for SUBSCRIBE method bodies; these bodies will typically modify, expand, filter, throttle, and/or set thresholds for the class of events being requested. Designers of extensions are strongly encouraged to re-use existing MIME types for message bodies where feasible.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-1030003"></A>5.1.4.	<A NAME="67836"></A>Subscriber SUBSCRIBE Behavior</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030687"></A>When a subscriber wishes to subscribe to (or refresh a subscription to) an event class, he forms a SUBSCRIBE message. If the subscription is call related, the call leg information (To, From, Call-ID) are used in the SUBSCRIBE message as if it were any other request related to the call.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030688"></A>The call leg information is formed as if for an original INVITE: the Call-ID is a new call ID with the syntax described in RFC 2543; the To: field indicates the suscribed resource's persistent address (which will generally match the Request URI used to form the message); and the From: field will indicate the subscriber's persistent address (typically sip:user@machine for UAs, or sip:machine for other entities).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030693"></A>The Contact: header will contain information about where resulting NOTIFY requests are to be sent. Each SUBSCRIBE request must have exactly one contact header.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030703"></A>Subscribers MUST include an &quot;Event&quot; header in SUBSCRIBE requests, indicating to which event or class of events they are subscribing. This header contains a token which corresponds to an extension draft; see section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#28631" CLASS="XRef">5.1.3.</A></P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031000"></A>SUBSCRIBE requests MAY contain an &quot;Accept&quot; header. This header, if present, indicates the body formats allowed in subsequent NOTIFY requests. Extensions making use of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY MUST define the behavior for SUBSCRIBE requests without &quot;Accept&quot; headers; usually, this will connote a single, default body type.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030694"></A>SUBSCRIBE requests MUST contain an &quot;Expires&quot; header. This expires value indicates the duration of the subscription. The formatting of these is described in RFC 2543. In order to keep subscriptions effective beyond the duration communicated in the &quot;Expires&quot; header, subscribers need to refresh subscriptions on a periodic basis. This refreshing is performed in the same way as REGISTER refreshes: the To, From, and Call-ID match those in the SUBSCRIBE being refreshed, while the CSeq number is incremented.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030722"></A>Similar to REGISTER, a natural consequence of this scheme is that a SUBSCRIBE with an &quot;Expires&quot; of 0 constitutes a request to unsubscribe from an event.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031478"></A>Due to the potential for both out-of-order messages and forking, the subscriber MUST be prepared to receive NOTIFY messages before the SUBSCRIBE transaction has completed.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031502"></A>The subscriber can expect to receive a NOTIFY message from each node which has registered a successful subscription or subscription refresh. Until the first NOTIFY message(s) arrive, the subscriber should consider the state of the subscribed resource to be in an undefined state. Extension drafts which define new event packages MUST define this &quot;undefined state&quot; in such a way that makes sense for their application.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030639"></A>Proxies need no additional behavior beyond that described in RFC 2543 <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#53863" CLASS="XRef">[1]</A> to support SUBSCRIBE. Note that SIP proxies may also act as subscribers or notifiers, as appropriate; under these circumstances, they will act as described in <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#67836" CLASS="XRef">5.1.4.</A> and <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#76046" CLASS="XRef">5.1.6.</A></P>

<H3 CLASS="Heading3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030496"></A>5.1.6.	<A NAME="76046"></A>Notifier SUBSCRIBE Behavior</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031008"></A>The notifier SHOULD check that the event package specified in the &quot;Event&quot; header is understood. If not, the notifier SHOULD return a &quot;489 Bad Event&quot; response to indicate that the specified event/event class is not understood.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030749"></A>The notifier SHOULD also perform any necessary authentication per its local policy. SIP authentication mechanisms are discussed in RFC2543. Note that, even if the notifier node typically acts as a proxy, authentication for SUBSCRIBE requests will always be performed via a &quot;401&quot; response, not a &quot;407;&quot; notifiers always act as a user agents when accepting subscriptions and sending notifications.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031104"></A>If authorization is not granted, the notifier SHOULD return a 600-class response.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030750"></A>Once the notifier has determined that it understands the event package and that the authenticated subscriber is authorized to subscribe, it returns a &quot;200 OK&quot; response. The &quot;Expires&quot; values present in this 200 response behave in the same way as they do in REGISTER responses: the server MAY shorten the interval, but MUST not increase it.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031457"></A>200 class responses to SUBSCRIBE requests will not generally contain any useful information beyond subscription duration; their primary purpose is to serve as a reliability mechanism. State information will be communicated via a subsequent NOTIFY request from the notifier.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031489"></A>Upon successful processing of a SUBSCRIBE request (i.e. a 200-class response), notifiers MUST send a NOTIFY message as soon as practical to communicate the current resource state to the subscriber. See section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#48698" CLASS="XRef">5.2.3.</A> for further details.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030804"></A>Note that privacy concerns may require that notifiers either use access lists or ask the notifier owner, on a per-subscription basis, whether a particular remote node is allowed to subscribe to a certain set of events. If such authorization fails, the notifier should reply to the request with a &quot;403 Forbidden&quot; request. See section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#67345" CLASS="XRef">6.</A></P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030769"></A>The other response codes defined in RFC2543 may be used in response to SUBSCRIBE requests, as appropriate.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031040"></A>When a notifier receives a subscription refresh, assuming that the subscriber is still authorized, the notifier updates the expiration time for the &quot;Contact:&quot; address present in the SUBSCRIBE. As with the initial subscription, the server MAY lower the amount of time until expiration, but MUST NOT increase it. The final expiration time is placed in the Expires header in the response.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031088"></A>If no refresh for a notification address is received before its expiration time, that address is removed from the list of addresses. If all notification addresses are removed, the entire subscription is deleted.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030047"></A>NOTIFY requests MUST contain the same Call-ID, local URI, and remote URI as the SUBSCRIBE request which ordered them. This is the same set of criteria that define a call leg.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031158"></A>The From field of a NOTIFY request MUST contain a tag; this allows for the subscriber to differentiate between events from different notifiers.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031528"></A>Note that successful SUBSCRIBE requests will receive only one 200-class response; however, due to forking, the subscription may have been accepted by multiple nodes. The subscriber MUST therefore be prepared to receive NOTIFY requests with &quot;To:&quot; tags which differ from those in the SUBSCRIBE 200-class response.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031162"></A>As expected, CSeq spaces are unique for each node; in other words, the notifier uses a different CSeq space than the subscriber and any other notifiers.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030293"></A>Identification of events being reported in a notification is very similar to that described for subscription to events (see section <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#28631" CLASS="XRef">5.1.3.</A>).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030294"></A>The Request URI of a NOTIFY request contains enough information to route the request to the party which is subscribed to receive notifications. It is derived from the &quot;Contact&quot; header present in the corresponding SUBSCRIBE request.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030322"></A>If the same events for different resources are being subscribed to, implementors are expected to use different &quot;Call Legs&quot; (To, From, Call-ID) in order to be able to differentiate between notifications for them, unless the body for the event contains enough information for this correlation.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031533"></A>As in SUBSCRIBE requests, NOTIFY &quot;Event&quot; headers will contain a single opaque token which identifies the event or class of events for which a subscription is being requested.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030296"></A>If the extension draft to which the event token corresponds defines behavior associated with the body of its NOTIFY requests, those semantics apply. This information is expected to provide additional details about the nature of the event which has occurred and the resultant resource state.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031147"></A>When present, the body of the NOTIFY request MUST be formatted into one of the body formats specified in the &quot;Accept&quot; header of the corresponding SUBSCRIBE request. The formatting rules and behavior when no &quot;Accept&quot; header is present are expected to be defined by the document which describes the relevant event package.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030345"></A>Note that sending a NOTIFY does not cancel the SUBSCRIBE which requested it; in other words, a single SUBSCRIBE request may trigger several NOTIFY requests.</P>

<H3 CLASS="Heading3">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030511"></A>5.2.3.	<A NAME="48698"></A>Notifier NOTIFY Behavior</H3>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031125"></A>When a SUBSCRIBE request is sucessfully processed or a relevant change in the subscribed state occurs, the notifier will construct and send a NOTIFY request to the subscriber(s). Such a message should be sent in as timely a manner as is practical.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031126"></A>If the notifier is able, through any means, to determine that the subscriber is no longer available to receive notifications, it MAY elect to not send a notification. An example of a method by which such information may be known is the &quot;SIP for Presence&quot; event set (see <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#78899" CLASS="XRef">[5]</A>).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031138"></A>If the original subscription contained a &quot;Record-Route&quot; and/or &quot;Contact&quot; header, notifications are sent according to the rules outlined in RFC 2543 <A HREF="draft-roach-sip-subscribe-notify-02.html#53863" CLASS="XRef">[1]</A>, as if the SUBSCRIBE were an INVITE, and the NOTIFY were any subsequent message (e.g. BYE).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031165"></A>Notify requests MUST contain a &quot;Contact&quot; header. This contact header is used by the subscriber in building &quot;Route&quot; headers for subsequent subscriptions (i.e. refreshes).</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031191"></A>A NOTIFY request is considered failed if the response times out, or a non-200 class response code is received which has no &quot;Retry-After&quot; header and no implied further action which can be taken to retry the request (e.g. &quot;401 Authorization Required.&quot;)</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031196"></A>If the response to a NOTIFY request fails, the notifier SHOULD remove the contact from the appropriate subscription. If removal of the contact leaves no remaining contacts, the entire subscription is removed.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031536"></A>NOTIFY requests MAY contain an &quot;Expires&quot; header which indicates the remaining duration of the subscription. The notifier MAY use this header to adjust the time remaining on the subscription; however, this mechanism MUST not be used to lengthen a subscription, only to shorten it. The notifier may inform a subscriber that a subscription has been removed by sending a NOTIFY message with an &quot;Expires&quot; value of &quot;0.&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="Body">

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1028267"></A>The ability to accept third-party subscriptions should be under the direct control of the user, since many types of events may be considered sensitive for the purposes of privacy. Similarly, the user agent should have the ability to selectively reject subscriptions based on the calling party (using either a white-list or black-list functionality), and/or using standard SIP authentication mechanisms.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1030812"></A>The mere act of returning a &quot;403 Forbidden&quot; response code to a SUBSCRIBE request may, under certain very rare circumstances, pose privacy concerns. In these cases, the notifier may elect to return a 200 response and send a NOTIFY message with (possibly erroneous) state. Note that this behavior is a rare exception, and should not be exhibited without justification.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-1031613"></A>The SIP for Presence draft (draft-rosenberg-impp-presence-00.txt) describes a mechanism by which presentities having access to registration information can accept registrations on behalf of user agents incapable of processing SUBSCRIBE requests. This is a very useful concept; however, it does not seem to be generalizable to all classes of events.
