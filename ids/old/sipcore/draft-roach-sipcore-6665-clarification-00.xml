    <abstract>
      <t>
        Experience since the publication of the most recent SIP
        Events framework has shown that there is room for
        interpretation around the use of Globally Routable User
        Agent URIs in that specification. This document clarifies
        the intended behavior.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates RFC 6665.

    <section title="Clarification of GRUU Handling">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target='RFC6665'/> section 4.5.1 contains the following
        normative requirement on implementations:
        <list style='hanging'><t>
   Notifiers MUST implement the Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU)
   extension defined in <xref target='RFC5627'/>, and MUST use a GRUU as their local
   target.  This allows subscribers to explicitly target desired
   devices.
        </t></list>
        The second sentence of this paragraph attempted to set
        context for the normative statement: the reason GRUUs are
        required in this context is to allow you to send SUBSCRIBE or
        REFER requests to a specific user agent, with the target of
        the subscription request being something like an INVITE
        dialog on that device. Consequently, the requirement to
        include a GRUU as a local target applies not just to the
        local target for SUBSCRIBE-created dialogs, but for *all*
        dialogs, even those created by INVITE.
      </t>
      <t>
        However, this requirement has been interpreted in a variety
        of ways by implementors, so a clarification is in order.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document updates <xref target='RFC6665'/> to clarify the
        actual requirement: "Notifiers MUST implement the Globally
        Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) extension defined in
        <xref target='RFC5627'/>, and MUST use a GRUU as their local
        target for all dialog-forming methods and all target-refresh
        methods. This specifically includes dialogs created by the
        INVITE method."
