  -- The draft header indicates that this document updates RFC3680, but the
     abstract doesn't seem to mention this, which it should.


  Miscellaneous warnings:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  == The copyright year in the IETF Trust and authors Copyright Line does not
     match the current year

     (Using the creation date from RFC3680, updated by this document, for
     RFC5378 checks: 2002-10-31)

  -- The document seems to lack a disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work, but may have
     content which was first submitted before 10 November 2008.  If you have
     contacted all the original authors and they are all willing to grant the
     BCP78 rights to the IETF Trust, then this is fine, and you can ignore this
     comment.  If not, you may need to add the pre-RFC5378 disclaimer.  (See the
     Legal Provisions document at http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info for more
     information.)

     IETF Trust Legal Provisions of 28-dec-2009, Section 6.c(iii):
        This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
        Contributions published or made publicly available before
        November 10, 2008.  The person(s) controlling the copyright in
        some of this material may not have granted the IETF Trust the
        right to allow modifications of such material outside the IETF
        Standards Process. Without obtaining an adequate license from the
        person(s) controlling the copyright in such materials, this
        document may not be modified outside the IETF Standards Process,
        and derivative works of it may not be created outside the IETF
        Standards Process, except to format it for publication as an RFC
        or to translate it into languages other than English.

  -- The document date (September 23, 2010) is 2533 days in the past.  Is this
     intentional?
