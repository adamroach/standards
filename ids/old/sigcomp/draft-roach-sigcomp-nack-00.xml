This document describes a mechanism that allows 
Signalling Compression (SigComp) implementations
to report precise error information upon receipt
of a message which cannot be decompressed. This
negative feedback can be used by the recipient
to make fine-grained adjustments to the compressed
message before retransmitting it, allowing
for rapid and efficient recovery from error
situations.

<section title="Introduction">

<t>Signalling Compression (see reference <xref target="sigcomp" />),
often called "SigComp",
defines a protocol for transportation of compressed messages
between two nodes. One of the key features of SigComp is the
ability of the sending node to request that the receiving
node store state objects for later retrieval.
</t>

<section title="The Problem">
<t>
While the "SigComp - Extended Operations" document
(reference <xref target="sigcomp-extended" />) defines a 
mechanism that allows for confirmation of state
creation, operational experience with the SigComp
protocol has demonstrated that there are still several
circumstances in which a sender's view of the shared
state differs from the reciever's view. A non-exhaustive
list of the
circumstances in which such failures may occur
are detailed below.
</t>

<section title="Compartment Disposal">
<t>
In SigComp, stored states are associated with compartments.
Conceptually, the compartments represent one instance
of a remote application. These compartments are used
to limit the amount of state that each remote application
is allowed to store. Compartments are created upon
receipt of a valid SigComp message from a remote application.
In the current protocol, applcations are expected to signal
when they are finished with a compartment so that it can
be deleted (by using the S-bit in requested feedback data).
</t>
<t>
Unfortunately, expecting the applications to be well-behaved
is not suffcient to prevent state from piling up. Unexpected
client failures, reboots, and loss of connectivity can cause
compartments to become "stuck" and never removed. To prevent
this situation, it becomes necessary to implement a scheme
by which compartments that appear disused may eventually be
discarded.
</t>
<t>
While the preceding facts make such a practice necessary,
discarding compartments without explicit signalling can have
the unfortunate side effect that active compartments are
sometimes discarded. This leads to a different view of state
between the server and the client.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Client Restart">
<t>
The prime motivation behind SigComp was compression of
messages to be sent over a radio interface. Consequently,
almost all deployments of SigComp will involve a mobile
unit as one of the the endpoints. Such units are not
generally highly available. Node restarts (due to e.g.
a battery running out) will induce situations in which
the network-based server beleives that the client contains
several states that are no longer actually available.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Server Failover">
<t>
Many high-availability schemes for IP servers involve load
distribution through a set of redundant servers that appear
to the sending user to be routers to the same destination
IP address. In these systems, the traffic to a failed server
is routed to an equivalently provisioned server.
</t>
<t>Although
SigComp state can be replicated amongst such a cluster
of servers, maintaining integrity of such states requires
a two-phase commit process, which adds a great deal of
complexity to the server, and can degrade performance significantly.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="The Solution">
<t>
Although SigComp allows returned SigComp parameters to
signal that all states have been lost (by setting
"state_memory_size" to 0 for one message in the
reverse direction), such an
approach provides an incomplete solution to the
problem. In addition to wiping out an entire compartment
when only one state is corrupt or missing, this approach
suffers from the unfortunate behavior that it requires
a compressed application-level message in the reverse
direction before recovery can occur. In many cases, such
as SIP-based mobile terminals, such
messages may be seldom; in others (pure client/server
deployments), they won't ever happen.
</t>
<t>
The proposed solution to this problem is a simple Negative
Acknowledgement (NACK) mechanism which allows the recipient
to communicate to the sender that a failure has occured. This
NACK contains a reason code that communicates the nature
of the failure. For certain types of failures, the NACK
will also contain additional details that might be useful
in recovering from the failure.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Node Behavior">
<t>
The following sections detail the behavior of nodes
sending and receiving SigComp NACKs. The actual
format and values are described in section 
<xref target="message_format" />.
</t>

<section title="Normal SigComp Message Transmission">
<t>
Although normal in all other respects, SigComp implementations
that use the NACK mechanism need to calculate and store a SHA-1
hash for each SigComp message that they send. This must be
stored in such a way that, given the SHA-1 hash, the implementation
is able to locate the compartment with which the sent message
was associated. Further, when a reliable transport is being
used, the implementation must be able to retrieve the
plain-text version of the original message.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Receiving a &quot;Bad&quot; SigComp Message">
<t>
When a received SigComp message causes a decompression
failure, the recipient forms and sends a SigComp NACK
message. This NACK message contains a SHA-1 hash of
the received SigComp message that could not be decompressed.
It also contains the exact reason decompression failed,
as well as any additional details that might assist
the NACK recipient to correct any problems.
See section <xref target="message_format" /> for more
information about formatting the NACK message and its
fields.
</t>
<t>
For a connection-oriented transport, such as TCP,
the NACK message is sent back to the originator of the
failed message over that same connection.
</t>
<t>
For a stream-based transport, such as TCP, the standard
SigComp delimiter of 0xFFFF is used to terminate the
NACK message.
</t>
<t>
For a connectionless transport, such as UDP,
the NACK message is sent back to the originator of the
failed message at the port and IP address from which
the message was sent. Note that this may or may not be
the same port to which the appliation would typically
receive messages.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Receiving a SigComp NACK">
<t>
The first action taken upon receipt of a NACK is
an attempt to find the message to which the NACK
corresponds. This search is performed using the
20-byte SHA-1 hash contained in the NACK. Once
the matching message is located, further operations
are performed based on the compartment that was
associated with the sent message.
</t>
<t>
Further behavior of a node upon receiving a SigComp NACK
depends on whether a reliable or unreliable transport is
being used.
</t>
<section title="Unreliable Transport">
<t>
When SigComp is used over an unreliable transport,
the application has no reasonable expectation that
the transport layer will deliver any particular
message. It then becomes the application layer's
responsibility to ensure that data is retransmitted
as necessary. In these circumstances, the NACK
mechanism relies on such behavior to ensure delivery
of the message, and never performs retransmissions
on the application's behalf.
</t>
<t>
When a NACK is received for a message sent over
an unreliable transport, the NACK recipient uses
the contained information to make appropriate
adjustments to the compressor associated with
the proper compartment. The exact nature of these
adjustments are specific to the compression scheme
being used, and will vary from implementation
to implementation. The only requirement on these
adjustments is that they must have the effect
of compensating for the error that has been
indicated (e.g. by removing the state that the
remote node indicates it cannot retreive).
</t>
<t>
In particular, when an unreliable transport is
used, the original message must not
be retransmitted by the SigComp layer upon
receipt of a NACK. Instead, the next application
initiated transmission of a message will take
advantage of the adjustments made as a result
of processing the NACK.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Reliable Transport">
<t>
When a reliable transport is employed, the application
makes a basic assumption that any message passed down
the stack will be retransmitted as necessary to ensure
that the remote node receives it. As such, many such
application provide no application-level reliability
mechanism. Because SigComp acts as a shim between the
transport-layer and the application, it
becomes the responsibility of
the SigComp implementation to ensure such retransmission
in the case of a detected failure.
</t>
<t>
When a NACK is received for a message sent over
a reliable transport, the NACK recipient uses
the contained information to make appropriate
adjustments to the compressor associated with
the proper compartment. The exact nature of these
adjustments are specific to the compression scheme
being used, and will vary from implementation
to implementation. The only requirement on these
adjustments is that they must have the effect
of compensating for the error that has been
indicated (e.g. by removing the state that the
remote node indicates it cannot retreive).
</t>
<t>
After such adjustments are made, the SigComp layer
re-compresses the original message and re-sends it
to the original recipient.
</t>
</section>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Message Format" anchor="message_format">
<t>
SigComp NACK packets are 
syntactically valid SigComp messages which have been
specifically designed to be safely ignored by
implementations that do not support the NACK mechanism.
</t>
<t>
In particular, NACK messages are formatted as
the second variant of a SigComp message (typically used
for code upload) with a "code_len" field of zero and
no input data. The NACK-specific information (message
identifier, reason for failure, and error details)
appears in the "returned feedback item" field. Further,
the "destination" field is used as a version identifier
to indicate which version of NACK is being employed.
</t>
<section title="Message Fields">
<t>
Although the format of NACK messages are the same
as the second variant of normal SigComp messages,
it is useful to demonstrate the specific fields
as they appear inside the "returned feedback item"
field.

<t>"Reason Code" is a one-byte value that indicates
the nature of the decompression failure. The specific
codes are given in section <xref target="status_codes" /></t>
<t>"SHA-1 Hash of failed message" contains the full 20-byte
SHA-1 hash of the SigComp message that could not be decompressed.
This information allows the NACK recipient to locate the
message that failed to decompress so that adjustments to the
correct compartment can be performed. When performing
this hash, the entire SigComp message is used,
from the header byte (binary 11111xxx) to the
end of the input. Any lower-level protocol headers (such as
UDP or IP) and message delimiters (the 0xFFFF that marks
message boundaries in stream protocols) are not included
in the hash. When used over a stream based protocol,
any 0xFFxx escape sequences are un-escaped before performing
the hash operation.</t>
<t>"Error Details" provides any additional information that
might be useful in correcting the problem that caused
decompression failure. Its meaning is specific to the

<section title="Reason Codes" anchor="status_codes">
<t>
Note that many of the status codes are more useful
in debugging interoperability problems than with
on-the-fly correction of errors. The "STATE_NOT_FOUND"
error is a notable exception: it will generally cause
the NACK receipient to encode future messages so as
to not use the indicated state.
</t>
<t>
Upon receiving the other status messages, an implementation
would typically be expected to either use a different
set of bytecodes or, if that is not an option, to send
that specific message uncompressed.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<section title="Reflector Attacks">
<t>
Because SigComp NACK messages trigger responses, it
is possible to trigger them by intentionally sending
malformed messages to a SigComp implementation
with a spoofed IP address. However, because such
actions can only generate one message for each
message sent, they don't serve as amplifier attacks.
Futher, due to the reasonably small size of
NACK packets, there cannot be a significant increase
in the size of the packet generated.
</t>
<t>
It is worth noting that nearly all deployed protocols
exhibit this same behavior.
</t>
</section>

<section title="NACK Spoofing">
<t>
Although it is possible to forge NACK message as if they
were generated by a different node, the damage that
can be caused is minimal. Reporting a loss of state
will typically result in nothing more than the
re-transmission of that state in a subsequent
message. Other failure codes would result in
the next message being sent using an alternate
compression mechanism, or possibly uncompressed.
</t>
<t>
Although all of the above consequences result in
slightly larger messages, none of them have particularly
catastrophic implications for security.
