  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ** The document seems to lack a Security Considerations section.

  ** The document seems to lack a both a reference to RFC 2119 and the
     recommended RFC 2119 boilerplate, even if it appears to use RFC 2119
     keywords. 

     RFC 2119, paragraph 2:
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

     RFC 2119 keyword, line 125: '...hanism described in this document MUST...'
     RFC 2119 keyword, line 127: '...  of HTML bodies SHOULD support the HT...'
     RFC 2119 keyword, line 128: '...f Atom documents SHOULD support Atom <...'
