<abstract><t>
This document proposes an addition of a
"409 Conflict" response code for the Session Initiation
protocol. This response code is required for a number
of application-specific purposes, and is expected to be
useful in future extensions to the protocol.
</t></abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
The first published version of SIP, RFC 2543, included
a "409 Conflict" response code borrowed from HTTP/1.1
<xref target="RFC2616" />. When copied into SIP, however,
this response code was unfortunately defined to apply
to an extremely narrow use case. This single use case
was subsequently deprecated by RFC 3261
<xref target="RFC3261" />; seeing no further
use for the 409 response code, the authors elected to
removed it at the same time.
</t>
<t>
Operational experience has demonstrated that various 
specialized applications occasionally encounter
circumstances in which a request cannot be processed
because doing so would result in an inconsistent or
disallowed state. This document seeks to reinstate
the 409 response code in a more general form
so that such situations can be accurately signalled
to UACs.
</t>
</section>

<section title="&quot;409 Conflict&quot; Response Code">
<t>
   The 409 response is added to the "Client-Error" header
   field definition. "409 Conflict" is used to indicate that
   the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
   state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where
   it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict
   and resubmit the request.
</t>
<t>
   Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to requests
   that create state in the network, such as REGISTER and
   SUBSCRIBE. The circumstances under which a 409 response
   code is returned are expected to be highly dependent on the
   application that the UAS provides.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Backwards Compatibility">
<t>
It should be noted that section 8.1.3.2 of RFC 3261
<xref target="RFC3261" /> defines UAC behavior upon
receipt of an unrecognized response code. Under the
behavior specified therein, a 409 response will be
treated by a client that does not understand it as
if it were a "400 Bad Request" response. The semantics
defined for that response indicate that the UAC should
not retry the same request without modification, which
is generally a reasonable course of action to take in
the case of a conflict.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
It is not beleived that the addition of the described 409
response code
has the ability to reveal sensitive information or provide
any additional avenues for attack.
</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
This document defines an additional SIP response code, which
is to be added to the method and response-code sub-registry under
http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

<abstract>
<t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.</t>
<t>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068.</t></abstract></front>
